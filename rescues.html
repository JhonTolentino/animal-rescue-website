    <h2>Find your Perfect Match</h2>
    <p>Some of our animals have had a bad start in life through neglect or abuse, others have had to be relinquished by reluctant families due to changes in circumstance. Some are old, some are young. They come in all shapes and sizes, all have different personalities and needs.</p>

          <h3>Pedro</h3>
          <p>I am a lovely, sweet, friendly boy who loves lots of fuss and cuddles! I have great recall in our field and love to chase tennis balls and bring them back to your feet to throw again! I also walk very nicely on the lead but can pull if I see another dog or a cat.  Since coming back to the rescue, I have now been muzzle trained.  I would like my new owner to take me to training classes to increase my confidence and give me lots of stimulation, and also help me to socialise with other dogs. I need an active home with lots of daily exercise because I am an energetic dog, though I do also like to have a nice relaxing snooze in my bed or cuddles on the sofa.</p>

          <h3>Simba</h3>
          <p>I am a very special boy looking for a long term foster home. I have been at the rescue for 3 years now patiently waiting for my forever home and now although I am given lots of love and attention I am losing my sparkle and desperately need a loving home of my own. I suffer from a few health problems which is why I am looking for a foster home. I suffer from a heart murmur, irritable bowel and I am prone to stress induced cystitis after suffering from a bladder blockage a couple of years ago. I am on a sensitive prescription diet which I will need to stay on for life but I am not on any other medication and none of these conditions have affected my cheeky and loveable nature! I am very loving with people I know and love to sit on your lap and have a cuddle. Please contact my carers if you would like to know more about me. </p>

          <h3>Sasha</h3>
          <p>I came to Animal Guardian Society when I was heavily pregnant and had to have a caesarean. Shortly after I gave birth I developed a bad infection and my kittens were hand reared by staff members. I am a typical female Torti, I love fuss and I let you know when I've had enough. I can be a bit cheeky and am full of character!</p>

          <h3>Jasper</h3>
          <p>I can be wary of new people and may need time to get to know you and trust you. I can be a bit snappy at times with new people and strangers so any potential owners must be willing to understand this and come to visit me here at the rescue centre regularly in order to gain my trust, but once you do, I promise you won't regret it!  Once I am happy with you, I am an adorable, friendly little livewire who is always on the go! I am very affectionate and love lots of fuss and attention and I especially enjoy treats!</p>

          <p>I may bark at the kennel if you come and see me, but if you give me a chance I promise to be the most loving and loyal companion.  I am looking for an active, adult only home with no other pets in the household.  If you think you could offer me a forever home, please come up and meet me.</p>
